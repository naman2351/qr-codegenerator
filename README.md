# qr-code-generator

Welcome to my self project named "QR code generator".
The purpose of this project is to fetch a Uniform Resource Locator(URL) from the user and convert it into a fully functional, scannable Quick response(QR) code.
The output is of the form of a png image file qr_img.png which can be scanned, and it redirects you to the required website.

STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT:

1.Install/fork the repo and check if the node files are present(if not, open your bash terminal and give command **npm install** to install all required node dependencies.)
2.Once you have all the files, run **node index.js** in the terminal.
3.Paste the required URL which you want to convert, next to the prompt.
4.Once the console returns a "Files created!" prompt, go to the **qr_img.png** file and scan the resultant QR code.
5.If the URL is valid, the QR code should redirect you to the same website.

The project is currently fully JavaScript-based and the future prospects include making it a Web based utility that is intuitive and easy to use for people who do not hold knowledge in the said domain.

Thank you for visiting my repo.
